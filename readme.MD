# Snow-crash

# Useful notes

First and foremost, this project is interesting but it can be sometimes tricky and not really well guided. You might feel lost but I assure you, you don't want to get the solution spoiled.

We did our best to try and write notes that won't spoil everything, they are separated by this kind of schema : Discoveries -> Exploit -> Token.

You can check the discovery parts if you feel like you've missed something or even the resources to have a comparative, but you should really not check the exploits without finding them or at least having a trail.

Else you're literaly cheating yourself and this project will suck.

If you need advices that you don't find on this repo, you can contact me on slack (ckurt) or on the [intra](https://profile.intra.42.fr/users/ckurt).

Happy hunting!
